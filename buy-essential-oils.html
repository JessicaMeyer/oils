            Ready to jump in and try the purest essential oils in the world? If you are interested in joining my team, I would love it! 
         </p>
         <p class="ready-to-buy-text">
            There are two options for creating an account with Young Living: Retail and Wholesale (recommended).
        </p>

        <p class="wholesaletitle"> Option 1 - Wholesale Member (recommended): </p>

        <p class="wholesaletext"> A wholesale member account is the way to go! You get 24% off purchases for life! To become a wholesale member with Young Living you select the Starter Kit you are interested in. </p>

        <p class="wholesaletext"><strong>The Premium Starter Kit is the best way to get started with essential oils!</strong> The Premium Starter Kit comes with 12 of the most popular essential oils, a diffuser of your choice, 2 sample packets of Ningxia Red drink, a sample of the Thieves household cleaner, 2 roller fitments and some literature. This starter kit is ideal for those wishing to start their journey with essential oils and use them aromatically and topically.</p>

       <p class="wholesaletext"><u> More information on your wholesale account: <br></u>
        - No renewal fee; simply purchase a minimum of $50pv of product per year and your account stays active. <br>
        - No order minimum - order whenever you like, as often as you like at 24% off retail prices. <br>
        - Although Young Living calls their wholesale customers “Distributors” this does NOT mean that you are signing up to sell oils and there is absolutely no pressure to do so - ever. <br>
        - Member number to share with friends; if they order using your member number, you’ll receive compensation (but, again, enrolling as a “Distributor” does NOT mean that you have to share oils with anyone; although; once you discover how wonderful they are, it will be hard not to tell your friends!) 
      </p>
  
        <p class="wholesaletitle"> Premium Starter Kit oils:</p>

      <p class="wholesaletitle">To enroll with my group, CLICK THIS LINK and make sure the number 10267084 appears in both “Enroller” and “Sponsor” fields.</p>

       <p class="wholesaletext">When you sign up wholesale, you will get invited to our private Facebook group, a place to learn everything you need to know about our amazing products and you will be plugged into the most supportive oily community.</p>

       <p class="wholesaletext">If you are <em>CURIOUS</em> about the business side of Young Living, we have an amazing team passionate about rising on another up. Families earning incomes! We have everything you need to help grow your business, including a free mentorship and resources for you to use.</p>

    <p class="wholesaletitle">Consider Essential Rewards:</p>
    
    <p class="wholesaletext">When checking out with your starter kit, feel free to select your starter kit as your <em>first Essential Rewards order</em>. This will qualify you for a free monthly 100 pv promo and starts your monthly order program called Essential Rewards (ER).</p>

    <p class="wholesaletext">Essential Rewards is their monthly wellness box (autoshipment), that can be customized each month to whatever you want. You can change the day anytime and cancel anytime. This is an optional program, but I bring it up because it's been amazing having everything shipped to my house!  I no longer need to shop items at Target or the grocery store because we buy (most) everything through them. In being a part of the Essential Rewards program, you earn points back on each order. These points can be used on free products, and you also qualify for promos each month for more free product. It's been so awesome and has saved us money. We are also using natural products, which I feel good about!
    </p> 


    <p class="wholesaletitle">Option 2 - Retail Member: </p>
    <p class="wholesaletext"> 
    - No starter kit required <br>
    - Order products whenever you would like (but pay 24% more than a wholesale customer).<br>
    - You can convert to a wholesale membership anytime by purchasing a starter kit.
