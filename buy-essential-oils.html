            There are two options for creating an account with Young Living: Retail and Wholesale (recommended).
        </p>

        <p class="wholesaletitle"> Option 1 (recommended) Wholesale Member: </p>

        <p class="wholesaletext"> A wholesale member account is the way to go! You get 24% off purchases for life! To become a wholesale member with Young Living you select the Starter Kit you are interested in. </p>

        <p class="wholesaletext">The Premium Starter Kit is the best way to get started with essential oils! The Premium Starter Kit comes with 12 of the most popular essential oils, a diffuser of your choice, 2 sample packets of Ningxia Red drink, a sample of the Thieves household cleaner, 2 roller fitments and some literature. This starter kit is ideal for those wishing to start their journey with essential oils and use them aromatically and topically.</p>
        
        More information on your wholesale account: 
        - No renewal fee; simply purchase a minimum of $50pv of product per year and your account stays active. 
        - No order minimum - order whenever you like, as often as you like at 24% off retail prices. 
        - Although Young Living calls their wholesale customers “Distributors” this does NOT mean that you are signing up to sell oils and there is absolutely no pressure to do so - ever. 
        - Member number to share with friends; if they order using your member number, you’ll receive compensation (but, again, enrolling as a “Distributor” does NOT mean that you have to share oils with anyone; although; once you discover how wonderful they are, it will be hard not to tell your friends!)
